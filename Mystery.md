<h3 style="text-align: left;">
I sometimes think that I am in the underworld 
<br><br>
Of the forgotten, left behind. 
<br><br>
Sitting, looking. . . trying to find myself in a lost world, 
<br><br>
Looking for something that isn't out there. 
<br><br>
I am a man that looks at things in a unhallowed state. 
<br><br>
I look at myself sometimes to think that I am unfounded. 
<br><br>
I sit and think of things sometimes to see that I am unfriended; 
<br><br>
To think that I am non existing. . . 
<br><br>
I talk some of the time to only be unheard, 
<br><br>
So why do I try to talk at all?. . . 
<br><br>
It's a question that is to be unanswered. 
<br><br>
To feel unwanted, is to feel unhesitating to the world that looks at me; 
<br><br>
To view me in a different light, but know that light has no meaning. 
<br><br>
I am a man that can live on and be undamaged. 
<br><br>
I am a puzzle to be put together. . .
<br><br>
I am Mystery…
