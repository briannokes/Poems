### I sometimes think that I am in the underworld 

### Of the forgotten, left behind. 

### Sitting, looking. . . trying to find myself in a lost world, 

### Looking for something that isn't out there. 

### I am a man that looks at things in a unhallowed state. 

### I look at myself sometimes to think that I am unfounded. 

### I sit and think of things sometimes to see that I am unfriended; 

### To think that I am non existing. . . 

### I talk some of the time to only be unheard, 

### So why do I try to talk at all?. . . 

### It's a question that is to be unanswered. 

### To feel unwanted, is to feel unhesitating to the world that looks at me; 

### To view me in a different light, but know that light has no meaning. 

### I am a man that can live on and be undamaged. 

### I am a puzzle to be put together. . .

### I am Mystery…
