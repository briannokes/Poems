<h3 style="text-align: center;">
To be so much in hate,
<br><br>

of this world you know,
<br><br>

and want to move on to other worlds;
<br><br>

to want to get away so much from the,
<br><br>

anguish, pain, sadness; the unjust, racist, unwilling to help.
<br><br><br>

There must be something better and more beautiful in life itself.
<br><br>
